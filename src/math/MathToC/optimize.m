(* Mathematica script, to be read by TensorEquationsToC.m:

   Given equations, try to optimize for best floating point performance:
   - reduce number of multiplies and adds by factoring common terms
     this is quite effective because our typical equations often contain
     products like g_ij (v^i + w^j) that have been expanded by the script
   - much more could be done here
