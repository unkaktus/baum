Changes in the amr for bam12

bam12 is simplified and cleaned up comparing older versions,
sometimes we have to 'reinvent' things, 
here is a list of reused functions added from older versions:

dtim 01/13 - different refinements around different objects

add parameter lmax2, which reduces the number of refinements 
around puncture1, puncture0 is untouched. 
In bam11 the more massive puncture was less refined, 
since we are now dealing with BHNS, we can not use this anymore, 
because the more massive BH needs more refinements than the NS. 

The removement is done in a way, where the box, which should be removed 
is set identically to the box we want to store on the same level, 
the mesh refinement does the rest for us.
